/**
  Manages the multicast receive filters of a network interface.

  This function is used enable and disable the hardware and software receive
  filters for the underlying network device.
  The receive filter change is broken down into three steps:
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Enable parameter are added to
    the current receive filter settings.
  * The filter mask bits that are set (ON) in the Disable parameter are subtracted
    from the updated receive filter settings.
  * If the resulting receive filter setting is not supported by the hardware a
    more liberal setting is selected.
  If the same bits are set in the Enable and Disable parameters, then the bits
  in the Disable parameter takes precedence.
  If the ResetMCastFilter parameter is TRUE, then the multicast address list
  filter is disabled (irregardless of what other multicast bits are set in the
  Enable and Disable parameters). The SNP->Mode->MCastFilterCount field is set
  to zero. The Snp->Mode->MCastFilter contents are undefined.
  After enabling or disabling receive filter settings, software should verify
  the new settings by checking the Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings,
  Snp->Mode->MCastFilterCount and Snp->Mode->MCastFilter fields.
  Note: Some network drivers and/or devices will automatically promote receive
    filter settings if the requested setting can not be honored. For example, if
    a request for four multicast addresses is made and the underlying hardware
    only supports two multicast addresses the driver might set the promiscuous
    or promiscuous multicast receive filters instead. The receiving software is
    responsible for discarding any extra packets that get through the hardware
    receive filters.
    Note: Note: To disable all receive filter hardware, the network driver must
      be Shutdown() and Stopped(). Calling ReceiveFilters() with Disable set to
      Snp->Mode->ReceiveFilterSettings will make it so no more packets are
      returned by the Receive() function, but the receive hardware may still be
      moving packets into system memory before inspecting and discarding them.
      Unexpected system errors, reboots and hangs can occur if an OS is loaded
      and the network devices are not Shutdown() and Stopped().
  If ResetMCastFilter is TRUE, then the multicast receive filter list on the
  network interface will be reset to the default multicast receive filter list.
  If ResetMCastFilter is FALSE, and this network interface allows the multicast
  receive filter list to be modified, then the MCastFilterCnt and MCastFilter
  are used to update the current multicast receive filter list. The modified
  receive filter list settings can be found in the MCastFilter field of
  EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE. If the network interface does not allow the multicast
  receive filter list to be modified, then EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER will be returned.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.
  If the receive filter mask and multicast receive filter list have been
  successfully updated on the network interface, EFI_SUCCESS will be returned.

  @param Snp              A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param Enable           A bit mask of receive filters to enable on the network
                          interface.

                          interface. For backward compatibility with EFI 1.1

                          must be set when the ResetMCastFilter parameter is TRUE.
  @param ResetMCastFilter Set to TRUE to reset the contents of the multicast
                          receive filters on the network interface to their
                          default values.
  @param MCastFilterCnt   Number of multicast HW MAC addresses in the new MCastFilter
                          list. This value must be less than or equal to the
                          MCastFilterCnt field of EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_MODE.
                          This field is optional if ResetMCastFilter is TRUE.
  @param MCastFilter      A pointer to a list of new multicast receive filter HW
                          MAC addresses. This list will replace any existing
                          multicast HW MAC address list. This field is optional

  This function performs read and write operations on the NVRAM device attached

  If ReadWrite is FALSE, a write operation is performed. Offset specifies the

  specified by Buffer will be placed on the transmit queue of the network
  interface, and EFI_SUCCESS will be returned. GetStatus() can be used to
  determine when the packet has actually been transmitted. The contents of the
  Buffer must not be modified until the packet has actually been transmitted.
  The Transmit() function performs nonblocking I/O. A caller who wants to perform
  blocking I/O, should call Transmit(), and then GetStatus() until the
  transmitted buffer shows up in the recycled transmit buffer.

/**
  Receives a packet from a network interface.

  This function retrieves one packet from the receive queue of a network interface.
  If there are no packets on the receive queue, then EFI_NOT_READY will be
  returned. If there is a packet on the receive queue, and the size of the packet
  is smaller than BufferSize, then the contents of the packet will be placed in
  Buffer, and BufferSize will be updated with the actual size of the packet.
  In addition, if SrcAddr, tAddr, and Protocol are not NULL, then these values
  will be extracted from the media header and returned. EFI_SUCCESS will be
  returned if a packet was successfully received.
  If BufferSize is smaller than the received packet, then the size of the receive
  packet will be placed in BufferSize and EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL will be returned.
  If the driver has not been initialized, EFI_DEVICE_ERROR will be returned.

  @param Snp        A pointer to the EFI_SIMPLE_NETWORK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param HeadSize   The size, in bytes, of the media header received on the network
                    interface. If this parameter is NULL, then the media header size
                    will not be returned.
  @param    On entry, the size, in bytes, of Buffer. On exit, the size, in
                    bytes, of the packet that was received on the network interface.
  @param Data       A pointer to the data buffer to receive both the media
                    header and the data.
  @param SrcAddr    The source HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL, the HW
                    MAC source address will not be extracted from the media header.
  @param DstAddr   The tination HW MAC address. If this parameter is NULL,
                    the HW MAC tination address will not be extracted from
                    the media header.
  @param Protocol   The media header type. If this parameter is NULL, then the
                    protocol will not be extracted from the media header. See
                    RFC 1700 section "Ether Types" for examples.
